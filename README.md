# Problem Statement  
The objective of this analysis is to evaluate a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza place to identify opportunities to drive more sales and improve operational efficiency. The analysis will focus on understanding sales patterns, customer preferences, and operational bottlenecks.



## 1. ASK  
Stakeholder: Maven (Manager)  

### Questions:  
- How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
- How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
- How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?
- Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?



## 2. PREPARE  
### Data Storage:  
The public dataset is completely available on the Maven Analytics website platform where it stores and consolidates all available datasets for analysis in the Data Playground. The specific individual datasets at hand can be obtained at this link below: https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-pizza-challenge

### Data Organized:  
This Pizza Restaurant Sales dataset uploaded by Shi Long Zhuang was downloaded from Kaggle.  
This dataset contains 4 file. It is saved on the computer in the Pizza Sales folder.



## 3. PROCESS
### Tools Used:  
- MySQL
- MS-Word

### Data Used:
order_details, orders, pizza_types, pizzas

### About Data:

## 6. ACT  
### Insights:
- Top-selling Pizzas: Classic Deluxe and Barbecue Chicken Pizza dominated the charts!
- Peak Hours: Evenings from 12:00-19:00 has the highest sales volumes.
- Customer Behavior: Large pizzas were more popular among group orders.

### Recommendations:
- Sales can be increased with a campaign on Sundays and Mondays, when pizza sales are lowest.
- Supreme and Veggie categories are the pizza categories with the worst sales, and XLarge and XXLarge sizes are the least sold pizza sizes. These categories and sizes can be evaluated in campaigns.
